The dashboard interacts with various GitHub RESTful API endpoints to query each repository with a series of checks that align to aspects of the policy.</p> <p>The dashboard is written in Python and uses Streamlit to produce a quick, easy and responsive UI. This project also makes use of a library called Plotly to produce high quality and interactive graphs.</p> <p>Please Note: This project is a Proof of concept and may not comply with Civil Service/ONS best practices.

This makes Streamlit well suited to the project due to the speed of development and heavy data focus. Streamlit also promotes interactivity within its apps which is crucial when making a dashboard as you want users to be able to play with the data to get the most from it. This project has been used as a proof of concept for Streamlit, testing its capabilities and potential for future projects. A small drawback is Streamlit's potential lack of accessibility. This project hasn't been accessibility tested but, due to its limited target audience, is still fit for purpose. Another limitation of the tool is its ability to be customised to look and feel like an ONS product. Streamlit offers customisation within its colour scheme and allows logos to be added, however it will still look like a Streamlit application.</p>"},{"location":"#plotly","title":"Plotly","text":"<p>Plotly is a graphing library used within the project. Plotly was chosen because of its high interactivity, ability to export and general ease of use alongside Streamlit. Other libraries, such as Matplotlib, were trialed alongside Plotly during early development. It was found that Plotly just generally suited Streamlit's feel and focus on interactivity, which is why it was chosen. Another advantage of Plotly was its incorporation with Dash, a dashboarding tool built on top of the Flask framework. This means that if Dash was to be used in the future (perhaps to onboard a dashboard onto the ONS Design System), we'd already have some knowledge on how to use it.</p>"},{"location":"#architecture-overview","title":"Architecture Overview","text":"<p>This project uses 4 major components:</p> <ul> <li>The Dashboard</li> <li>The Lambda Function</li> <li>The Policy Checks (policy_checks.py)</li> <li>The GitHub API Toolkit (stored in another repository - Repository Link)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#the-dashboard","title":"The Dashboard","text":"<p>This component displays the data back to the user.
