# GitHub Policy Dashboard Screen Designs

Below are the screen designs which were created between requirement scoping and development. These designs have been revised with stakeholders to provide a baseline for what the dashboard *should* look like. Not all design cues were carried into the final development and, ;ikewise to the [initial scoping](./initial_scoping.md), may no longer fully represent the UI within the project.
